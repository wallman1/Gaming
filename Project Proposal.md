**Design Brief**  
The project will be a video game based on H.P.Lovecraft's ‘Tales of Horror’ tuned towards teens and young adults.

**Book Choice**  
The book being used in this project is ‘Tales of Horror’ by H.P.Lovecraft. The book is a collection of H.P.Lovecraft’s best short stories from within the Cthulhu mythos. The book includes Dagon in which an American soldier who escapes a German naval detention centre washes up on a strange piece of land that is covered in a black, gelatinous substance that slowly dries and leads the soldier into ruins of a lost and horrific civilisation. The book also includes The Call of Cthulhu in which a young researcher inherits a strange box of research from his uncle that leads him to the unholy Cthulhu cult who are trying to contact cosmic horrors and elder gods. I chose this book because it is a literary classic that inspired many of our modern day horror stories, movies and games. 

**UX Type**  
The Project will take the form of a video game because the interactive and immersive nature of a video game allows the user to fully immerse themselves in the horror of the stories.

**Target Market**  
The intended audience is teens and young adults who have interests in horror and literature. This project will appeal to the target audience due to its interactive nature, unique story and gameplay.

**Software and Tools**  
The project will use Unity, to create the main game, Adobe Illustrator, to design UI elements, and Github to document and save the project to. Unity allows for a wide array of different games and creative ideas, Adobe Illustrator is effective for many large UI elements and Github is an industry standard that allows for quick commits to the cloud allowing access from anywhere.

**Mind Map**
![alt text for screen readers](/Images/Screenshot%202025-05-22%20222700.png)

**Functional Requirements**

**The project needs to be playable**

- The game must have clear goals, interactive gameplay mechanics, and progression systems.  
  - Controls should be intuitive and responsive across supported devices.

**The project needs to be identifiably about H.P. Lovecraft**

- The game should feature themes, characters, or mythos drawn from Lovecraft’s work (e.g., cosmic horror, madness, forbidden knowledge, unknowable entities).  
  - Visuals, narrative tone, and terminology should align with Lovecraftian aesthetics.  
  - Direct or inspired references to stories from H.P. Lovecraft

**The project needs to have a functional user experience**

- The user interface (UI) must be clean, intuitive, and provide essential feedback to the player (e.g., health status, inventory, objectives).  
  - Menus, tooltips, and in-game prompts should be consistent and easy to navigate.  
  - Onboarding/tutorial features should help new players understand mechanics without external guides.

**Users can play the game without it crashing**

- The game must be stable under normal use conditions (e.g., loading scenes, saving progress, interacting with objects/NPCs)  
  - Error handling and recovery (e.g., saving system backups or auto-saves) should be in place.  
  - The game must pass basic QA tests for crashes, freezes, and performance bottlenecks.

**The project needs to have reasonable technological requirements**

- The game should run smoothly on target platforms with modest hardware (e.g., mid-range PCs, consoles, or mobile devices).  
  - Load times should be optimized, and the game should not require excessive memory or storage.  
  - Dependency on third-party services or online features should be minimal or clearly justified.

**Non-Functional Requirements**  
**The project should have aesthetically pleasing assets**

- Art direction should be consistent with the Lovecraftian horror theme (e.g., dark tones, surreal environments, grotesque designs).  
- Assets should maintain a high standard of quality, including textures, models, animations, and effects.  
- Character and environmental designs should visually communicate mood and setting effectively.  
  **The project should instill a horror-like feeling in a user**  
- Use psychological horror elements such as tension, dread, and unpredictability, rather than relying solely on jump scares.  
- The narrative and visuals should evoke fear of the unknown, helplessness, and existential dread—a hallmark of Lovecraftian horror.  
- Player choices or discoveries may lead to feelings of paranoia, insanity, or awe.  
  **The project should be accessible**  
- Include options for colorblind modes, subtitle support, control remapping, and difficulty scaling.  
- Design should account for various disabilities (e.g., visual, auditory, motor) following accessibility guidelines (like WCAG or Xbox Accessibility Guidelines).  
- Clear visual and audio indicators should support gameplay for all users.  
  **The project should have immersive sound design**  
- Background music, ambient noise, and sound effects must complement the horror atmosphere.  
- Dynamic or spatial audio should be used to increase tension and immersion (e.g., footsteps behind the player, eerie whispers).  
- Audio cues should support gameplay mechanics (e.g., alerting the player to danger or triggering psychological unease).  
  **The project should have immersive and aesthetically pleasing environments**  
- Environments should feel lived-in, mysterious, and emotionally resonant with the narrative.  
- Lighting, weather, and environmental storytelling (e.g., clues, graffiti, object placement) should contribute to immersion.  
- The game world should feel cohesive and believable within its supernatural context.

**Social Impact**  
This is a game for teens and young adults who enjoy reading and story telling. There is a lot of written text in this game, so players will need to be able to read well in order to fully enjoy it. The game also relies heavily on visuals, especially through environmental storytelling—where objects and the environment tell parts of the story—so players will also need to be able to look and understand what's happening around them. The game could also lead the players to explore further into older fiction, especially traditional horror. It could also lead them to H.P. Lovecraft, the creator of the idea of "cosmic horror" and dread of the unknown and unknowable. But let's keep in mind that Lovecraft's work includes racist ideas that no longer pass today. These passages will be removed or edited to make the game respectful and inclusive of all players.

**Ethical Responsibility**  
The game will collect a minimum of data needed to play, such as Unity's default data and player preferences such as accessibility options. Personal preferences saved will be kept secure and used only to improve the player experience. The game will focus on the storytelling of a haunting and suspenseful story, maintaining the cosmic and psychological horror elements. This means making use of darkness, frightening sounds, and mysterious storytelling, but it won't rely on gruesome or startling content for its own sake.

**Legal Considerations**  
A few of Lovecraft's lines or quotations from his original books may be used in the game, for instance, in recordings or notes. These should be short and duly accredited to the author. Since Lovecraft's work is in the public domain these days, it is permissible to reuse some parts of it, especially if the game changes or adds new setting to the material (this is known as "fair use"). Also, as the game is not being sold or making any money, it will not go against any of Unity's publishing policies. Precaution will be taken not to include any content that would still be copyrighted or trademarked from other firms.

**HUD Wireframe Feedback**  
The Heads-Up Display (HUD) is the most important aspect of the user interface (UI) for this project, and it must be executed correctly if one is to have an acceptable overall experience. Feedback collected with a Google Form distributed among the computing class indicated that most of the participants wished to see a health bar show the player's health. A considerable number of individuals also thought that more information would be shown on screen to help with gameplay. In a follow-up interview with another colleague, there was a suggestion that the health bar might be made more explicit—perhaps in numerical or percentage terms to inform the player more clearly about what they are doing. There was also an allusion to reducing the prominence of the crosshair so it does not break immersion. The idea of immersion was a thread that ran through the feedback. One of the participants mentioned that rather than having all the information presented on the screen in front of them, it would be more immersive to have it integrated into the game world. As an example, a notebook could be used to write down the days, and the wristwatch could show the time of day. These in-world objects would maintain the atmosphere but provide the player with the information they require.

**First Prototype**  
The first prototype of my H.P. Lovecraft-inspired game was the splash screen. While it was simple and easy to understand, it lacked strong visual appeal and did not meet a high aesthetic standard. Additionally, it did not provide enough information for the player to understand what to expect from the game. These issues were identified through multiple interviews with peers who tested the prototype and provided feedback.

**Second Prototype**  
My second version of the H.P. Lovecraft-themed horror game incorporated the first complete level, with essential gameplay elements like player movement, interacting with the environment, and aspects like photo-taking and notebooks. Peer questionnaire responses found both strengths and weaknesses. The notebook system was specifically complimented for its simplicity and effectiveness in story development. The photo mechanic was also highly complimented for creating environmental awareness and tension and mystery build-up.

General criticism did exist, though, of the jittery, unpolished movement system that detracted from immersion—something integral to a first-person horror game. The environment itself was also noted as sparse and having no atmosphere, reducing the intended horror effect. Suggestions were that ambient lighting, audio, and narrative props need to be included to augment the setting. While the prototype did effectively ground key mechanics and narrative potential, emotional effectiveness was stifled by these design issues. In the future, I would like to extend movement fluidity and build an even more atmospheric, immersive environment through richer visuals and audio, further bringing the game into harmony with its Lovecraftian atmosphere.

**Final Prototype**  
The environment was tastefully designed and aesthetically pleasing. It lacked prominent atmospheric elements like ambient sound and lighting, reducing the overall degree of tension and immersion to be found in a horror game. The game ran flawlessly without any serious bugs or frame rate issues, with clear signs of good technical performance and streamlined design. Controls were intuitive and simple to use, so the gameplay progressed naturally. Problems did occur with the notebook system, where hitboxes were sometimes difficult to interact with, which affected gameplay flow. The photo system added an interactive element, though sometimes failed to be consistent. Images often did not register right, which took away from the system's value in allowing for exploration and story-building. The prototype was shown to have sound development, with sturdy core design and smooth-as-silk performance. Refining atmosphere, interaction accuracy, and photostability will help enhance immersion and overall gameplay worth in future releases.

**Final Evaluation**
The last prototype correctly solves most of its functional and non-functional requirements. It is stable, fully playable, and has good controls and stable performance on mid-range hardware. The game accurately conveys H.P. Lovecraft's themes through its tone, visuals, and storytelling style, fulfilling its fundamental objective. Interactive mechanisms like progression and exploration are lively and operational, and the interface is mostly seamless, though UI and onboarding can be refined. Non-functionally, the game includes rich environments and a sufficient horror ambiance, though room is left to better asset quality, accessibility features, and audio design. Overall, the prototype does what it's meant to do quite well, with several points left for betterment in the future.

The final product effectively meets the intentions outlined in the design brief. It is clearly inspired by H.P. Lovecraft’s Tales of Horror, with direct references to stories like Dagon and The Call of Cthulhu reflected in the game’s themes, tone, and narrative style. The game captures the essence of Lovecraft’s cosmic horror through its atmosphere, visuals, and use of mysterious, unsettling environments. It is well-suited for its target audience of teens and young adults, especially those interested in horror and literature, as it includes quotes and notes throughout the gameplay that deepen engagement with the source material. The interactive nature of the game successfully delivers the immersive user experience intended in the brief, making the horror elements more personal and effective. Overall, the project aligns well with its original purpose and target audience.

The project effectively manages significant social, ethical, and legal responsibilities, especially considering its source material and user experience. Socially, the game appeals to teenagers and young adults with an appreciation for storytelling and literature, offering engagement in traditional horror without introducing offending material found in Lovecraft's original work. This renders the experience respectful and inclusive, avoiding racist content found in the source material. Morally, the game avoids excessive violence and graphic content and instead focuses on psychological and atmospheric horror, making it more acceptable to a wider audience. It also remains user-friendly by collecting minimal, non-intrusive information that is only used to enhance gameplay, and storing saved preferences in a secure manner. Legally, the game uses short, quoted text from Lovecraft's public domain work, staying within fair use principles and Unity policies to not include copyrighted or commercial content. Throughout, the project has very good regard for good design practice, offering a richly atmospheric horror experience without forgoing sensitivity to its audience or source material.

Time, resource, and process management throughout the project was quite well managed. While earlier stages had consistent progress, it was realized that the project was more ambitious than initially expected. This resulted in some time pressure at the later stages, with extra effort being required to meet final deadlines. However, key milestones were still achieved, and the critical features were completed. Where there were issues—e.g., getting some of the mechanics to fit in—there were changes made, not always quite as successfully as might have been desired. Overall, there was a little last-minute cramming, but the project was completed successfully, and lessons were learned about the scoping and time management of future projects.

User input was gathered and responded to with a highly effective extent throughout the project. Playtesting and peer feedback helped highlight areas where gameplay could be made more intuitive, such as improving control responsiveness and making interactive components more intelligible. Feedback also suggested areas where the game atmosphere could be improved, leading to the refinement of environmental design and narrative presentation. These changes had a beneficial impact on the user experience and pushed the game closer to its intended tone and look. Certain aspects—such as environment detail and shine on certain mechanics—still require more work to further meet user expectations and create greater immersion. Feedback overall was crucial to driving design decisions and further refining the final product. The game could be significantly enhanced through the addition of more levels, which would provide greater gameplay variety and enable the integration of additional mechanics I have developed.

**Ongoing Evaluation**
May 1st: I focused on developing the first-person shooter (FPS) controller and implementing player movement mechanics within the game. Utilizing Unity’s built-in assets and standard character controller components, I configured basic movement functionalities such as walking, running, and looking around. This laid the foundation for responsive and immersive player controls.

May 2nd: I worked on setting up the photo capture and score system for the game. I employed a camera-based mechanic where the player can take in-game photos, which are then graded to determine what their quality and content are. Based on pre-set criteria—such as the position, distance, and framing of the subject—a score is calculated and displayed to the player. This is intended to encourage competent and thoughtful taking of pictures, adding depth and complexity to the game.

May 6th: I spent time enhancing the user experience by implementing two significant features: an interaction system and a photo gallery. The photo gallery feature allows players to view and browse through the photographs they have taken throughout the game, leaving behind a visual memory of their adventure and encouraging exploration. I implemented an interaction system as well, which provides players with the interaction capability for in-game objects, i.e., notebooks. When a character gets near and activates a notebook, the system reveals what is inside so that story information or hints may be communicated. These implementations contribute to more depth in gameplay as well as story aspects of the project.

May 7th: I spent time crafting and constructing the environment and terrain of Level 1, which is set in Antarctica. I utilized the terrain features in Unity to construct a cold, harsh environment that reflects the extremes and remoteness of the continent. I applied snow and ice textures to give it a visually realistic environment and incorporated appropriate environmental objects such as ice formations, snow drifts, and distant mountain ranges to enhance immersion. The setting was thoughtfully crafted in a way that accented the tone and gameplay

May 9th: The day was spent placing and positioning all the props in the Level 1 area. This included carefully placing items such as tents, research equipment, broken tools, and other theme-related objects in order to add more realism and storytelling of the Antarctic landscape. Each prop was carefully positioned to manage player movement, enable environmental storytelling, and increase the atmosphere as a whole. Both visual style and gameplay functionality were given attention, in that props not merely contributed to the aesthetic decoration of a scene but also had an interactive or narrative role where appropriate.

May 12th: I designed and completed the splash screen for my game as part of the final presentation elements. The splash screen includes the game’s title and a simple background image to introduce the project in a clean and visually appealing way.

May 18th: I began working on Level 2 of the game. This involved mapping out the first terrain and layout of the level, and designing its overall layout, objectives, and player advancement. I focused on establishing the baseline characteristics, including environment layout, navigation paths, and key areas of interaction. The goal now was to create a structure that was definable and would bring life to the gameplay mechanics and story advancement within the level while maintaining consistency within tone and style established in Level 1.

May 20th: I completed the development of Level 2. This included finalizing the terrain, placing environmental assets, and adding interactive elements to ensure a cohesive and engaging gameplay experience.
